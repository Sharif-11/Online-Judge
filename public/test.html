<p>
  <b>Hello Coders,</b>
</p>
<p>
  We are proud to finally invite you to participate in
  <b>Coding Battle Round #118</b>
  , which will start on <b>Friday, September 2, 2022 at 18:45<sup>UTC+6</sup></b
  >. You will be given <b>3</b> problems, and <b>1</b> hours to solve them. We
  greatly encourage you to read all the problems.
</p>
<!--First problem-->
<p>
  William has array of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>n</sub>. He
  can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:
</p>
<p>
  1. Pick any two items from array a<sub>i</sub> and a<sub>j</sub>, where a<sub
    >i</sub
  >
  must be a multiple of 2
</p>
<p>2. a<sub>i</sub>=a<sub>i</sub>/2</p>
<p>3. a<sub>j</sub>=a<sub>j</sub>*2</p>
<p>
  Help William find the maximal sum of array elements, which he can get by
  performing the sequence of operations described above.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Input</b>
</p>
<p>
  Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
  test cases <b>t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>)</b>. Description of the test cases
  follows.
</p>
<p>
  The first line of each test case contains an integer <b>n (1 ≤ n ≤ 15)</b>,
  the number of elements in William's array.
</p>
<p>
  The second line contains n integers
  <b>a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>n</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> < 16)</b>,
  the contents of William's array.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Output</b>
</p>
<p>
  For each test case output the maximal sum of array elements after performing
  an optimal sequence of operations.
</p>
<!--second problem-->
<p>You are given <b>q</b> queries in the following form:</p>
<p>
  Given three integers <b>l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>i</sub></b
  >, find minimum <b>positive</b> integer <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> such that it is
  divisible by <b>d<sub>i</sub></b> and it does not belong to the segment
  <b>[l<sub>i</sub>,r<sub>i</sub>]</b>.
</p>
<p>Can you answer all the queries?</p>
<p>Recall that a number x belongs to segment <b>[l,r] if l ≤ x ≤ r</b>.</p>
<p>
  <b>Input</b>
</p>
<p>
  The first line contains one integer <b>q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500)</b> — the number of
  queries.
</p>
<p>
  Then <b>q</b> lines follow, each containing a query given in the format
  <b
    >l<sub>i</sub> r<sub>i</sub> d<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ l<sub>i</sub> ≤ r<sub
      >i</sub
    >
    ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>, 1 ≤ d<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>)</b
  >. <b>l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>i</sub></b> are integers.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Output</b>
</p>
<p>For each query print one integer: the answer to this query.</p>





<!--Third Problem-->
<p>
  Alice has a lovely piece of cloth. It has the shape of a square with a side of
  length a centimeters. Bob also wants such piece of cloth. He would prefer a
  square with a side of length b centimeters (where b<a). Alice wanted to make
  Bob happy, so she cut the needed square out of the corner of her piece and
  gave it to Bob. Now she is left with an ugly L shaped cloth (see pictures
  below).
</p>
<p>
  Alice would like to know whether the area of her cloth expressed in square
  centimeters is prime. Could you help her to determine it?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Input</b>
</p>
<p>
  The first line contains a number <b>t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5)</b> — the number of test
  cases.
</p>
<p>
  Each of the next <b>t</b> lines describes the i-th test case. It contains two
  integers <b>a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 10<sup>11</sup>)</b> — the side length of
  Alice's square and the side length of the square that Bob wants.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Output</b>
</p>
<p>
  Print t lines, where the i-th line is the answer to the i-th test case. Print
  "YES" (without quotes) if the area of the remaining piece of cloth is prime,
  otherwise print "NO".
</p>
<p>You can print each letter in an arbitrary case (upper or lower).</p>
